# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**From Digital Intelligence to Physical Embodiment**

Welcome to this comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This resource bridges the gap between artificial intelligence theory and real-world robotic systems, providing you with the foundational knowledge needed to understand how intelligent machines interact with the physical world.

## What You Will Learn

This textbook covers six interconnected modules that build upon each other:

| Module | Topic | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Introduction to Physical AI | Foundational concepts and terminology |
| 2 | ROS 2 Fundamentals | Robot communication and control systems |
| 3 | Simulation Environments | Digital twins with Gazebo and Unity |
| 4 | NVIDIA Isaac Platform | Perception, SLAM, and navigation |
| 5 | Vision-Language-Action | AI-driven robot behavior |
| 6 | Capstone Project | Integration of all concepts |

## Learning Path

Each module follows a consistent structure designed for effective learning:

1. **Introduction** - Learning objectives and module overview
2. **Key Concepts** - Core theoretical foundations
3. **Practical Workflows** - Hands-on understanding (technical modules)
4. **Summary** - Key takeaways
5. **Knowledge Check** - Self-assessment questions

## Prerequisites

This textbook assumes:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Interest in robotics and artificial intelligence

No prior robotics experience is required. All concepts are introduced progressively, with each module building on knowledge from previous sections.

## How to Use This Textbook

**Recommended approach:**
1. Read modules in sequential order (1 through 6)
2. Complete Knowledge Checks before moving to the next module
3. Review referenced documentation for deeper understanding
4. Use the Capstone module to integrate all learned concepts
